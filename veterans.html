His parents were initially notified that he was missing in action, and in May 1946, Secretary Forrestal reported that the Snook had been sunk in enemy-controlled waters with the loss of her entire crew.</p>

He was declared killed in action by the U.S. Navy when his submarine failed to return to port. He is survived by his parents, three sisters, and a brother, who received a Navy discharge and was employed at a local war plant. A military marker has been placed at Fountain Hill Cemetery.</p>

      <p><strong>DOB:</strong> January 21, 1920 | <strong>DOD:</strong> February 22, 1943 </p>
      <p>  Corporal Joseph J. Smith (January 21, 1920 – February 22, 1943) was the first service member from Deep River to be killed in World War II. A standout baseball player at Deep River High School and in the Middlesex County semi-pro league, Joe enlisted immediately after hearing the news of Pearl Harbor. He trained at Fort Bragg and Indiantown Gap before deploying to England and then North Africa with the first divisions to land there, where his artillery battery earned a citation for exceptional performance. Joe wrote home often, especially to his young sister Delores, who learned geography through his letters. He was killed in action at age 23 in Tunisia and was laid to rest in the American Military Cemetery there, where his parents chose to have him remain with the men he served beside.</p>
